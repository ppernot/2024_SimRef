We demonstrate that {CAM}-B3LYP yields atomization energies of similar quality to those from B3LYP, while also performing well for charge transfer excitations in a dipeptide model, which B3LYP underestimates enormously. The {CAM}-B3LYP functional comprises of 0.19 HartreeâFock ({HF}) plus 0.81 Becke 1988 (B88) exchange interaction at short-range, and 0.65 {HF} plus 0.35 B88 at long-range.

  abstract     = {Generalized gradient approximations ({GGA}'s) for the exchange-correlation energy improve upon the local spin density ({LSD}) description of atoms, molecules, and solids. We present a simple derivation of a simple {GGA}, in which all parameters (other than those in {LSD}) are fundamental constants. Only general features of the detailed construction underlying the Perdew-Wang 1991 ({PW}91) {GGA} are invoked. Improvements over {PW}91 include an accurate description of the linear response of the uniform electron gas, correct behavior under uniform scaling, and a smoother potential.},

  abstract     = {Atomization reactions are among the most challenging tests for electronic structure methods. We use the first-principles Weizmann-4 (W4) computational thermochemistry protocol to generate the W4-17 dataset of 200 total atomization energies (TAEs) with 3Ï confidence intervals of 1 kJÂ molâ1. W4-17 is an extension of the earlier W4-11 dataset; it includes first- and second-row molecules and radicals with up to eight non-hydrogen atoms. These cover a broad spectrum of bonding situations and multireference character, and as such are an excellent benchmark for the parameterization and validation of highly accurate ab initio methods (e.g., CCSD(T) composite procedures) and double-hybrid density functional theory (DHDFT) methods. The W4-17 dataset contains two subsets (i) a non-multireference subset of 183 systems characterized by dynamical or moderate nondynamical correlation effects (denoted W4-17-nonMR) and (ii) a highly multireference subset of 17 systems (W4-17-MR). We use these databases to evaluate the performance of a wide range of CCSD(T) composite procedures (e.g., G4, G4(MP2), G4(MP2)-6X, ROG4(MP2)-6X, CBS-QB3, ROCBS-QB3, CBS-APNO, ccCA-PS3, W1, W2, W1-F12, W2-F12, W1X-1, and W2X) and DHDFT methods (e.g., B2-PLYP, B2GP-PLYP, B2K-PLYP, DSD-BLYP, DSD-PBEP86, PWPB95, ÏB97X-2(LP), and ÏB97X-2(TQZ)).
