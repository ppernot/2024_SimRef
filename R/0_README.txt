"How hard can it be to validate a calibration metric ?"

* "main.R" the main code, calls several scripts:

* "functions.R" auxillary functions
* "getData.R" reads datasets
* "datasetsProperties.R" estimates some properties of the datasets
   and generates figures of error and uncertainty distributions
* "calcZetaScores.R" calculates the zeta-scores and generate main results figure
* "testCLT.R" generates results and figs for Appendix B
* "testValidRCE.R" generates results for Appendix C
